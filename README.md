# University-Admission-Prediction_Using_Multiple_Linear_Regression
This project uses a third-party app, Machine Leaning for University Admission Prediction, to enhance your learning experience. The app will reference basic information like your name, email, and Coursera ID

In this project, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:

1. Understand the theory and intuition behind Multiple Linear Regression.

2. Import Key python libraries, dataset and perform data visualization

3. Perform exploratory data analysis and standardize the training and testing data.

4. Train and Evaluate different regression models using Sci-kit Learn library.

5. Build and train an Artificial Neural Network to perform regression.

6. Understand the difference between various regression models KPIs such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, and adjusted R2.

7. Assess the performance of regression models and visualize the performance of the best model using various KPIs.
